        Hello! My name is Scott Nels Quinaud, and I am a second-year BSIT
        (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) student. I chose this
        course because I am interested in technology and how it helps make
        tasks easier and more efficient. I enjoy learning about programming,
        computer systems, and creating projects that improve my skills and
        creativity.
